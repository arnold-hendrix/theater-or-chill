      Every day it seems liklier that the near future will require us to learn
      how to live with COVID-19. We at TheaterOrChill understand that movie
      enthusiasts around the world want to continue watching new movies as they
      are released, even as inconveniences caused by COVID-19 lockdown measures
      and safety protocols continue to impact their lives.

    <p>
      That is why we have launched a platform where movie fans can decide
      whether to rent or go see a movie in theaters - at no extra cost. Movie
      rentals are valid while the movies are in theaters. In other words, once
      you have rented a movie, you have it available to you for as long as it is
      available on our website. You can stream it as many times as you want!
      Isn't that cool?
    </p>

      Having said that, we are not discouraging going to the movies. That's why
      those of you who decide to watch a movie in theaters will earn rewards on
      every visit! After four visits, you will have enough rewards to get
      yourself a free ticket to your fifth visit, and a $15 voucher that can be
      applied to food, drinks, and movie memorabilia at a theater near you.
    </p>
    <p>So, thanks for stopping by and hopefully we will see you again!</p>

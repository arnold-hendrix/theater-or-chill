Front end Angular application for theater-or-chill movie app: https://theater-or-chill.herokuapp.com/ - This link loads a previous iteration of the app. I thought by pushing new commits Heroku would update the content on the url automatically, but that hasn't happened. I will look into it.

I have added an actual news section to the front page of the app. I have also learned about flexbox and css grid which have helped me format things better especially with
regards to app responsiveness.
